# P5ReactionProtocol
In our 5th semester project, we proposed a reaction protocol for mitigation of DDOS attacks.

Our implementation in this repository, is purely a proof-of-concept, developed in order to prove that our protocol may work in real world.
We used Mininet to simulate a small network. Nodes in this network may implement our protocol, and other nodes may fire a DDOS attack against a selected victim. We proved that our proposed protocol can mitigate the amount of traffic generated towards the target.
