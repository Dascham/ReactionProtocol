#Add things to this readme when necessary

#This is where our reaction protocol will run

#The single delegator should be running an instance of the DelegatorClient as well as an instance of the DelegatorServer
#because a single delegator should always be able to take respond to clients (victims, and other delegators), making the
#delegator act as a server, as well as being able to pass messages to other delegators (delegator as client).
