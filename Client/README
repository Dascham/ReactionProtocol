#An example of this kind of client could be an amazon server, making it the potential victim of a DDoS attack.
#Therefore this kind of client would need code, that can receive messages from an IDS signaling a DDoS attack.

#This client would also need code that sends messages to delegators (although only 1 delegator), making this part of the
#code that implements a part of the reaction protocol.
