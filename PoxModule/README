#we will be running a pox module. This module has the responsibility of making sure that, when a packet comes in
#for a given switch that the destination address of that packet is matched against destination adresses in the table for
#that switch. If there is an entry in that table, then the module has to put that packet into the DDoS queue else the
#default queue

#The module has to be able to receive messages from a delegator. The reason for this is, that all communication between
#a delegator and a switch is done through the controller(pox module).
